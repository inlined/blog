# Six ways beginners can improve buoyancy

Learning to drive a car overwhelmed me so much I wasn't sure I wanted to
learn to drive. For many new divers, especially [Open Water](1) students,
buoyancy control is equally overwhelming. Eventually, like driving, buoyancy
control becomes automatic. Still, it's possible to feel like we've
reached a comfortable level of control while still making basic mistakes
that keep us from reaching the next level of enjoyment in our dives.

Proper buoyancy control can dramatically increase your dive time. Dumping less
out of your BCD saves more air for you to breathe. Poor buoyancy control can
also lead to overexertion, causing you to consume much more air per minute.
Good buoyancy control is a major reason why scuba instructions can often
complete an entire [Open Water](1) or [Advanced Open Water](2) course on a
single tank of air.

We should also improve our buoyancy because it just makes diving more fun!
We improve our trim, which reduces our drag and lets us get places quicker
and more subtly. This gives us more time to enjoy the dive, helps us dive in
stronger currents, and lets us get within touching distance of wildlife (not
that you should _actually_ be touching it).

This guide covers the buoyancy techniques appropriate for the most common
styles of diving. It doesn't cover changes introduced by dry suits, which
add another air-space; or rebreathers, which introduce a counter-lung.
If this article inspires you, consider taking the
[Peak Performance Buoyancy](3) specialty class as an opportunity to hone
your skills. Buoyancy control can also be one of the five dives included
in your [Advanced Open Water](2) class; ask your instructor if (s)he can
include this in your training.

## 1. Remember your BCD isn't an elevator

Many new divers find the BCD counter-intuitive, especially because its use at
the surface and underwater are reversed. On the surface, you inflate to stay
up and you deflate to go down. Underwater, you deflate _as_ you go up and
inflate _as_ you go down. This is the opposite of what many expect until
they remember that buoyancy changes have a synergistic effect. As we rise,
we are under less pressure. This expands the air in our exposure suits and BCDs
which makes us positively buoyant and causes us to rise even faster. To 
avoid a runaway ascent, we should let out small bursts of air from our BCD, not
_to_ rise, but _because_ we are rising. Likewise, we avoid emergency descents
by inflating our BCD, which has begun to crush under higher pressure.

It's worth repeating that a BCD (and drysuit) should be adjusted in _small
increments_. If we add big bursts, we're likely to overshoot our goal and
it will be even harder to find the right level of inflation.

## 2. Use your breath

If your BCD isn't an elevator, what is? Primarily, it's our lungs. Lungs are
great because we're so used to using them. We'll never forget which way to
inflate or deflate our lungs like many new or rusty divers forget on their
BCD's inflator hose. If you want to go deeper, just breathe out more than a
normal breath and slowly "sip" the fresh air back in. If you want to go
shallower, breath in more than a normal breath and slowly exhale. You can even
use this trick to help find the right depth for your BCD rather than adjusting
your BCD for your depth. If your BCD makes you _slightly_ positively buoyant,
exhale deeply to decrease your bouyancy. If you decrease it enough to sink, the
increased water pressure will compress your BCD and make you neutrally bouyant
when you resume normal breathing.

Two rules worth repeating

- _Never hold your breath while scuba diving_. Holding a full breath during
ascents can lead to lung overexpansion, which can be fatal.
- _Avoid shallow breathing_. Only the air that reaches our lungs (or
more accurately, the avioli) replenishes our blood with oxygen. The throat and
broncial cavity are "dead airspace." If we don't breath more volume than the
dead airspace, we're literally wasting our breath. If you find you're getting
headaches after diving (and trust the air quality of your dive shop), you may
be breathing too shallowly and suffering from carbon dioxide buildup.

## 3. Try to be stationary without kicking
I've seen divers with 2-3x my experience make this basic mistake. It's easier
to stay streamlined and feel neutrally bouyant while you're moving because
you're actually steering vertically. When you're stationary however, you
might find yourself oriented vertically and _kicking_ to avoid sinking.
This exertion wastes a lot of air; fix it by inflating your BCD until you
no longer need to kick. When properly bouyant, you can choose to stay
horizontally oriented and still. Save your kicks for moving or fighting a
current.

## 4. Dial-in the correct weight for your dives
Your trim can give you an intuition whether you're properly weighted. Divers
carrying too much weight often angle upwards as they swimming against sinking.
Divers carrying too little weight often angle downwards as they swim against
floating.

As you learned in your Open Water and Peak Performance Bouyancy dives,
a pre-dive weight check is the best way to find the correct weight. To do a
weight check, hold a _normal_ breath at the surface of the water and let out
all the air from your BCD. Repeat this process, adding or removing weight,
until you hover in the water at about eye level. Remember that you're not
done yet! That air in your tank has noticeable weight and you will become
positively buoyant as it depletes. To avoid kicking downwards at the end
of your dive, add 5lbs or 2-3Kg to reach your final weight.

You can make this process much faster as you gain experience. Always record
the weight used,  exposure suit (e.g. Wetsuit or drysuit? If a wetsuit, 3/4 or
full coverage and how many mm thick?). Some even recommend recording the brand
and model of the wetsuit, though I find this unnecessary; I'm more likely to
record whether I used a steel or aluminum tank. If you use a dive logbook
[like mine](4), you'll find dedicated inputs for all of these. Otherwise I
like recording this at the bottom of your notes.

Once you know how much weight you need, you can experiment with the placement
and kinds of weight you use. This helps you stay trim and can increase your
safety, such as using both an integrated and belt weight system so you can
ditch less of your weight at a time during an emergency ascent. If you buy
your own BCD, many choose a back inflator like the [Scubapro Hydros Pro](5).
This improves your trim because there isn't an inflated vest hugging you like
the BCDs you probably wore in Open Water training. Back inflators tend to 
push you forwards at the surface, so many allow you to add [soft weights](6)
or you can add [weight pockets](7) to your tank strap. Finally, if you suffer
from what I call "scorpion legs" (legs that curl up while you're diving),
consider [ankle weights](8). Record ankle weights separately in your log book
since many don't find these affect the amount of weight needed for buoyancy.

## 5. Keep practicing
Use downtime to improve your buoyancy skills. Your
local dive shop may let you use the pool where they teach classes as
long as you're not away. You can use this time to practice fin
pivots and hovering. Since you should always practice using new gear in
confined water before you dive, these make especially good practices
when you buy a new BCD, wetsuit, or drysuit, as they affect your buoyancy
the most.

You can also practice buoyancy during safety stops. You may notice that
the most experienced divers can hover during their safety stops without
holding a rope. If you want to practice this skill, I recommend staying
close enough to the rope to grab it during an uncontrolled ascent or
descent. Hover with your arms outstreatched so you can continuously watch
your SPG or dive computer. Pros can sense small changes in their depth
through inner ear pressure; as a beginner you won't have this sixth sense yet.

## 6. Forgive yourself for struggling
Shallower water changes proportional density faster. A shift from 16ft (5m)
to 33ft (10m) is a change from 1.5atm to 2atm of pressure–a 33% increase.
Meanwhile, a shift from 66ft (20m) to 82ft (25m) is a change from 3atm to
3.5atm–a 16% increase. That's half the proportional density change with
the same change in depth!

As a new diver, you're more likely to dive in shallower depths. This means
you're learning an overwhelming skill in less forgiving waters. Remember there
is a big difference between "I'm struggling" and "I'm never going to get it."
Forgive yourself and give yourself time to hone your skills.
