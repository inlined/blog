## Why scuba?
Many people like scuba diving for various reasons. Some see it as a form of
adventure; they need to "see what's down there". Some use Scuba to get away,
both from stress and to travel across the world.

Whatever your reason, there's nothing quite like scuba diving.

## Why write about scuba?
They say that teaching is the best way to learn. 
this blog gives me, and others, the opportunity to sharpen the knowledge we
prepare to share.

## Who am I?
A resident of the San Francisco Bay Area and a passionate diver. I started
diving in 2010 and my passion for the sport has only accelerated since then.
I am currently a [master scuba diver](1) with over 100 dives under my belt.
