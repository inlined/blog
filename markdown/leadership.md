# Five leadership skills I learned as a Divemaster

Scuba is my passion (and weekend job). My day job is as a software engineer.
Both roles require active leadership and each offer new insights for being
a better leader. Here are some ways I learned to be a better lead software
engineer through scuba diving.

## 1. Give affirmative instructions

Remember Anna Karenina: "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way." Affirmative instruction focuses on the one
happy path rather than the way a mentee has strayed from it.

Tell your mentees the behavior you want them to exhibit rather than the
behavior you want them to stop. For example, I once told students "Don't
grip the whole end of your LPI hose like that; you're starting to hold the
inflator and deflator button at the same time." Those students picked up
the right behavior much slower than the next students, who I told "Hold
the LPI hose along the side so you can more easily hit _just_ the inflator
or deflator button."

## 2. Let them stumble

A divemaster assists with classes and catches mistakes. Except in circumstances
where a student is making a dangerous or costly mistake, resist the urge to
step in. Most times a student will realize that something isn't working.
If they're completely unaware, offer a gentle reminder that something is wrong.

Your goal is to push your mentee into a problem-solving state. They will come
to you if they're truly stuck; try to guide them with more questions rather
than answers. The answers they learn by themselves will be much more readily
remembered.

## 3. Make mentees mentor each other

This leadership skill is more straightforward for scuba diving where everybody
has an assigned "buddy". After mentees are expected to have learned a particular
skill, give feedback to their buddy or peer that the mentee is struggling. I
tell students that they are their buddy's keeper. I tell students that their
buddy is holding their reserve air supply and they should care for their buddy
because they may depend on that buddy underwater. If a student gets in the
water without turning on their air or forgot a weight belt I turn to the buddy
and ensure they know that _they_ made a mistake by not catching these issues
in a [buddy check](1).

This culture of peer accountability gives you time to mentor more people and
further improves the skills your mentees develop. Their chance to mentor
and teach others gives them leadership practice and reinforces their own
knowledge and skills.

## 4. Measure your feedback

Everyone has a finite amount of information they can hold in their head. PADI
calls this "cognitive load" and warns about overwhelming students. Pick your
battles wisely to keep feedback within a mentee's maximum cognitive load.
I tell my stellar students that I give feedback for two kinds of people:
those who need it and those who can handle it.

If a mentee is having difficulties, focus on the minimum performance
requirements. The little things will overload the mentee and detract from the
critical knowledge and skills. On the other hand, when a mentee is excelling,
they have an opportunity to get bored. In scuba, they may cause students to
lose focus or distract the class with their board actions. Give these
high-performers more to work on to increase their cognitive load.
You can give them more nuanced feedback or introduce new skills. Keep this
feedback short and measured; it should keep them from being bored during
a class rather than distracting them through it.

## 5. Empathize and develop a routine

As your skills improve, you'll forget what it was like to earn those skills.
Try hard to remember growing. Where you have a series of mentees who will
repeatedly learn the same skills, gain a sense of pace for learning those
skills. Use this information to create an aggressive but reasonable pace for
mentorship. Remember that all mentees are unique, empathize with any
difficulties, and offer extra help where appropriate.
