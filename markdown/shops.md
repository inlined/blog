# Recommended dive shops

Dive shops vary significantly in quality of instruction. Across the globe,
some shopw will let you dive without formal training. Scuba has the potential
to be a hazardous sport but is comparably safe due to the standards and
practices of organizations like PADI. Even though you may be able to go
diving without training in Cazumel, I strongly recommend getting trained in
your home town _before_ going on your dream dive vacation. Formal training
increases your safety and training ahead of time lets you spend more time on
your vacation and can increase the duration or complexity of the dives you
take there.

## Bay Area, California

I personally affiliate with [Harbor Dive](1). They take their practice
more seriously than any other shop I've worked with. Their customers love
them for their wealth
of knowledge and their professional conduct. Harbor Dive's instructors are
fun and efficient. They pay meticulous attention to detail and really drill in
the important lessons in practical application. I've especially appreciated
times when the class was paused, the tone got serious, and they reminded or
quizzed me on important safety precautions.

For example, how do cold water and unfamiliar environments affect you when
diving? Both can increase the rate at which you breath, so you should add
10 feet or 3 meters for each to get a new theoretical dive depth. This is
especially important when diving with enriched air to avoid oxygen toxicity.

## Pheonix, Arizona

My "away" shop while visiting family in AZ is
[No Limits Scuba](2). Their staff is very competant,
their shop is well stocked, and they even give equipment discounts to students!
I especially enjoyed my [Rescue Diver](3) course, which was combined with
Emergency First Responder training and the [Emergency O2 Provider](4) specialty
course for a comprehensive training in the subject.

Be sure to check their board for their weekly "sale of the day" to get the best
rate on various supplies.
