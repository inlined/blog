# A deep dive on weights

Many new divers are so focused on having enough weight to sink but end up
over-weighted. Use the minimal necessary weight to swim with less exertion
and preserve air. You'll also improve your buoyancy with less air in your BCD.
A fuller BCD expands and contracts more severely as you change depth.
This requires more skill to remain neutrally buoyant.

Your trim can give you an intuition whether you're properly weighted. Divers
carrying too much weight often angle upwards as they swimming against sinking.
Divers carrying too little weight often angle downwards as they swim against
floating. Divers who don't distribute their weight will often bow down at the
waist. This makes the diver less streamlined and can cause back pain.

Here are some ways to get properly weighted with the right kinds of weight:

## Perform a buoyancy check

As you learned in your Open Water and Peak Performance Buoyancy dives,
a pre-dive weight check is the best way to find the correct weight. To do a
weight check, hold a _normal_ breath at the surface of the water and let out
all the air from your BCD. Repeat this process, adding or removing weight,
until you hover in the water at about eye level. You should do this exercise
with a nearly empty tank (this is less important with a steel tank).
If your tank is full, it will become less buoyant as you
use up air, so add 5lbs or 2-3Kg to reach your final weight. This helps
you avoid kicking downwards at the end of your dive.

## Keep notes

Buoyancy checks can take time. Speed up the process with detailed records in your
log book. At minimum record the type of suit you used and the amount of weight
you used. My [preferred log book](0) has dedicated places for these. You can
also record more detailed: I personally record one of the following types of
suits: rashguard, 3mm shorty, 3mm, 7mm, 5+7mm (a 5mm hooded vest under a 7mm),
7mm semi-dry, or dry. Some divers who rent gear also include the brand name of
their suit and their BCD since each will affect buoyancy

For weights, consider annotating the distribution of your weights; this helps
you recreate good trim. Mark your weights as belt, ditchable, trim, or ankle.
Steel tanks are heavier than aluminum and are also worth noting in your log.

## Know your options 

As you adjust your weight for neutral buoyancy, you can also adjust their placement
for proper trim. Know your options to improve flexibility.

The oldest kind of weight is the weight belt. You can use the
traditional [nylon belt](1) threading [lead plates](2).
You'll see these often on liveaboards because they allow users to adjust the belt's
weight. The downside is that these weights can be hard against your
waist and they can slip without the correct threading technique
or [belt keepers](3). Some belts [have pockets](10)
for easy and consistent placement of weights. Other belts come with 
[fixed soft weights](4) for increased comfort at a premium price.

Most modern BCDs also come with a detachable weight system.
These are easily filled with [lead shot bags](5) or [BCD weights](6)
for more consistent placement. If you use an integrated weight
system, be sure your buddy knows how to ditch the weights
in an emergency.
Also consider using both integrated weights and a belt
so that you
can ditch less weight at a time.

Many divers, especially those using [back-inflator BCDs](7) feel thrust
forwards at the surface. To counteract this, we lean back and add "trim"
weights behind the BCD. Many BCDs will have pockets for
these trim weights on the back on either side
of the tank. Fill these pockets only enough to stay
vertical at the surface; too much weight will roll you
onto your back when you hover underwater. If your BCD doesn't 
have trim pockets or you need a more centered weight,
you can buy [weight pockets](8) that fit on your tank strap.

If you suffer from a condition I call "scorpion legs",
where your calves tend to curl up while hovering, consider
using [ankle weights](9).
These help you keep trim. They don't affect your
buoyancy as much as other weights, so they should be recorded
separately in your log book.

It can take time to fine tune all these options. I prefer
lead shot weights because they increase flexibility. They fit in
integrated and trim weight pockets. If your belt includes pockets, they
will also support lead shot bags. Buy more bags of lighter weight
so you can fine tune both the quantity and placement of your weights.

## Exceptions

Most rules are meant to be broken occasionally. If you are diving with a dry
suit, extra weight means extra warmth. You inflate your suit to counter
the weight you're carrying which gives you a thick layer of air like a
parka in the winter.

Many instructors also choose to be negatively buyant when teaching a diving skill.
This can offers a stable position while demonstrating skills. It can also
help you intentionally perform a skill worse (e.g. exaggerated fin pivots) so
that students see examples at a skill level they can expect to copy.

Finally, divemasters may carry extra weight while giving tours. This weight is
stored somewhere easily removable, including clipped onto their BCD, so they
can offer their divers more weight if necessary.
