# A deep dive on weights

## Advantages of proper weighting
* Use less air
* stay warm in a dry suit

## Kinds of weights
Once you know how much weight you need, you can experiment with the placement
and kinds of weight you use. This helps you stay trim and can increase your
safety, such as using both an integrated and belt weight system so you can
ditch less of your weight at a time during an emergency ascent. If you buy
your own BCD, many choose a back inflator like the [Scubapro Hydros Pro](5).
This improves your trim because there isn't an inflated vest hugging you like
the BCDs you probably wore in Open Water training. Back inflators tend to 
push you forwards at the surface, so many allow you to add [soft weights](6)
or you can add [weight pockets](7) to your tank strap. Finally, if you suffer
from what I call "scorpion legs" (legs that curl up while you're diving),
consider [ankle weights](8). Record ankle weights separately in your log book
since many don't find these affect the amount of weight needed for buoyancy.

## Buoyancy checks
As you learned in your Open Water and Peak Performance Buoyancy dives,
a pre-dive weight check is the best way to find the correct weight. To do a
weight check, hold a _normal_ breath at the surface of the water and let out
all the air from your BCD. Repeat this process, adding or removing weight,
until you hover in the water at about eye level. Remember that you're not
done yet! That air in your tank has noticeable weight and you will become
positively buoyant as it depletes. To avoid kicking downwards at the end
of your dive, add 5lbs or 2-3Kg to reach your final weight.

You can make this process much faster as you gain experience. Always record
the weight used,  exposure suit (e.g. Wetsuit or drysuit? If a wetsuit, 3/4 or
full coverage and how many mm thick?). Some even recommend recording the brand
and model of the wetsuit, though I find this unnecessary; I'm more likely to
record whether I used a steel or aluminum tank. If you use a dive logbook
[like mine](4), you'll find dedicated inputs for all of these. Otherwise I
like recording this at the bottom of your notes.

Your trim can give you an intuition whether you're properly weighted. Divers
carrying too much weight often angle upwards as they swimming against sinking.
Divers carrying too little weight often angle downwards as they swim against
floating.
