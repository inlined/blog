<a name="cylindar">Cylindar</a> (aka "tank"): A large canister of air.
Imperial measurements of cylindars measure the total volume of uncompressed
air in the cylindar (e.g. 80 cubic feet) stored at a particular pressure
(e.g. 3400 PSI). Metric measurements of cylindars measure the volume
of the cylindar itself (e.g. 12 litres) and the pressure of air inside the
cylindar (e.g. 200 bar)

<a name="regulator">Regulator</a> (aka "reg"): A device that regulates the
release of air from a cylindar. Air can be drawn from a regulator from both
the high pressure and low pressure chambers. A high pressure chamber is used
for a [spg](#spg), whereas the low pressure chamber feeds 
[second stages](#second-stage), a [low pressure inflator](#lpi), or a
[drysuit](#drysuit). A regulator can be balanced or unbalanced, which
determines whether the low-pressure delivery is (mostly) independent
from the high-pressure itensity or not.

The term "reg" is mildly ambiguous. It can be slang for any of the following:
* The first and second stage, which are typically sold as a unit

  _"I'm looking to buy a reg; is this one balanced?"_

* Everything connected to the first stage, when taking inventory or assembling 
  equpiment.

  _"I pack my reg in carryon when I travel to make sure it doesn't get banged up"_

* The second stage, when referring to breathing or scuba exercises involving
  breathing

  _"I saw a seal; he seemd very curious about my reg"_

<a name="first-stage">First Stage</a>: The portion of the [regulator](#regulator) which converts high pressure air from the [cylinder](#cylinder) into an intermediate pressure.

<a name="second-stage">Second Stage</a>: The portion of the [regulator](#regulator) from which a diver breathes. The second-stage

<a name="safe-second">Safe Second</a> (aka "octopus" or "octo"): A redundant [second stage](#second-stage) which allows a divers' buddy to breath from the same tank. A safe second is brightly colored (usually yellow) and loosely fastened in a the triangle formed by the diver's chin and hips.

<a name="smb">Surface Marker Buoy</a> (aka "smb" or "dsmb"): A safety device
that can allow divers to be identified visually from afar. Surface marker
buoys are carried, deflated, by divers and inflated on demand. A "regular"
surface marker buoy, is generally inflated at the surface and needs to be
orally inflated; these SMBs are often a mandatory safety feature of drift
diving because it allows divers to be identified if they are separated from
the group.

A "delayed" surface marker buoy contains upgrades that allow it to be inflated
underwater. These upgrades include a purge valve in case the SMB overinflates
and an open bottom that allows the SMB to be inflated via an 
[octo](#safe-second) and allows air to escape if the SMB overinflates while
rising. Due to this open bottom, tension must be kept on the SMB to avoid it 
collapsing at the surface. Delayed SMBs are especially useful for letting 
boats know divers are below _before_ they surface.

Surface marker buoys are color coced: orang is a general purpose color, whereas
yellow is only used in distress. The slang "smb" covers both general and
delayed surface marker buoys, whereas "dsmb" more specifically means a delayed
smb.
