# Things we don't do anymore

<!-- This is really long; should it be a series? -->

## Combined CESA & out of air exercises
When I was first certified, the CESA (Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent) portion of the Open Water certification was combined with the out of air exercise. That's right, they cut off your air, waited for you to signal, and then expected you to swim to the surface on one breath.

We used to do this because it greatly increased confidence in the safety of an out of air situation in shallow water. I feel completely comfortable in approximately 30 feet or less because I know I can handle any emergency as long as I don't have overhead cover.

We no longer follow this practice because it was deemed too dangerous. Even without shutting off air, students are still prone to panicking during a CESA exercise. Panicking 20ft underwater without air is a risk that PADI deemed not worth the exercise.

## Emergency ascent exercises
When I took Open Water training in 2010, we practiced an actual emergency ascent. This is a last-resort ascent where one drops their weights underwater. This can make the diver extremely positively buoyant and they will very possibly rise faster than the recommended 1ft/0.3m per second. To help mitigate the risk, a diver should increase drag by flaring out and scream the air out of their lungs.

It seems fairly straightforward why this is now only a scholastic practice. This is a last-resort practice that puts the diver in actual danger to avoid catastrophe. If the diver ascends too fast they can suffer decompression sickness (aka "the bends") and if they fail to scream hard enough, they can suffer lung overexpansion injuries.

This is still part of the written curriculum, and we still try to use actual practice to instill the value of dropping weights. Instead, we now have students deflate their BCD at the surface and drop their weights. Until their weights drop, the student will need to swim vigorously to stay afloat; after dropping weights the student should be positively buoyant and float easily. This is a safe compromise that helps students intuit the benefits fo dropping weights while avoiding the risk fo decompression illness from training.

## Closing cylinders a quarter turn
Students were previously taught to fully open a cylinder's valve and then close it a quarter turn. This used to be a good practice to avoid the cylindar's valve from sticking. As technology improved, this became unnecessary, but was still often taught out of habit. Unfortunately, after a diver's death, this is now forbidden from teaching and you should stop doing this in your daily practice.

Why is closing a quarter turn dangerous? _Because it's too hard to tell between a quarter-turn closed and a quarter turn opened_. If you accidentally close your buddy's valve and open it a quarter turn, the air pressure coming from the tank is higher than the ambient pressure from the surface, so the diver will be able to breathe. The SPG may give a potential warning sign–the pressure reading may drop while testing the air–but this isn't guaranteed to happen nor is the diver guaranteed to notice.

If the tank is only a quarter turn opened, then the tank will stop being able to deliver air once the ambient pressure gets too high. In one case study, this happened to a diver while they were exploring a cave. With overhead, they were unable to ascend and drowned. Due to the now-clear risk, this practice was demoted from outdated to forbidden.

## Dive tables
Open Water students no longer need to learn how to use the RDP (Recreational dive planner), nor is it popular to plan multi-level dives with an eRDP ML. The reason is obvious: dive computers have become more reliable in the last decade and are preferred over dive tables because they extend your dive time.

Decompression theory models the amount of nitrogen absorbtion over time at a given pressure. When planning a dive using the RDP, we assume our dive is one solid block at a given depth–simple geometry that is extremely conservative. A dive computer is able to sample your depth repeatedly and more accurately measure saturation over time–more accurate calculus that calculates more accureate limits. In addition, dive tables account for the "controlling compartment" at a given fixed depth (the body tissue that will reach its saturation limit first). A dive computer can track all compartments' saturation and understand which compartments are saturating and which are desaturating at different depths. These small changes can add up to a big difference: Belize's blue hole is 130ft (40m) deep. With an RDP, the entire dive can last only 10 minutes. Using a dive computer, my team was able to ascend after eight minutes and stretch the dive out to 34 minutes safely.

Finally, many dive computers can be programmed to accept any blend of enriched oxygen or adapt to any altitude. This means that a single computer can replace multiple dive tables.

Even if we don't often use dive tables anymore, it's still useful to know how to use them. Dive tables help explain _why_ a computer does what it does. You can know when a safety stop is required instead of just recommended. You understand how surface intervals affect your artifical (nitrogen) bottom time and can calculate the minimum surface interval for your dive time. You'll also be aware of rules like the "WXYZ" rule, which can force you to take a surface interval of one or three hours if you accidentally hit it! Finally, if you plan to become an instructor, you'll need to understand decompression theory. Understanding how a dive table works and its differences from a dive computer are a good foundation for understanding the Haldane decompression model.
