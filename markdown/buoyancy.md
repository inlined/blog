# Six ways beginners can improve buoyancy

Learning to drive a car overwhelmed me so much I wasn't sure I wanted to
learn to drive. For many new divers, especially [Open Water](1) students,
buoyancy control is equally overwhelming. Eventually, like driving, buoyancy
control becomes automatic. Still, it's possible to feel like we've
reached a comfortable level of control while still making basic mistakes
that keep us from reaching the next level of enjoyment in our dives.

Proper buoyancy control can dramatically increase your dive time. Dumping less
out of your BCD saves more air for you to breathe. Good buoyancy control lets
you spend less energy and use less air per minute. This is why some 
instructions can complete an entire [Open Water](1) or [Advanced Open Water](2)
course on a single tank of air, while their students need a tank per dive.

We should also improve our buoyancy because it just makes diving more fun!
We improve our trim, which reduces our drag and lets us get places quicker
and more subtly. This gives us more time to enjoy the dive, helps us dive in
stronger currents, and lets us get within touching distance of wildlife (not
that you should _actually_ be touching it).

This guide covers the buoyancy techniques appropriate for the most common
styles of diving. If this article inspires you, consider taking the
[Peak Performance Buoyancy](3) specialty class as an opportunity to hone
your skills (If you live in the California Bay Area, I can teach you this
class personally). Buoyancy control can also be one of the five dives included
in your [Advanced Open Water](2) class; ask your instructor if (s)he can
include this in your training.

## 1. Remember your BCD isn't an elevator

The acronym BCD can stand for "buoyancy control device" or "buoyancy
compensation device." The latter term is more recent and more accurate.
Thinking of the BCD as a "controller" leads to confusion and inefficient
diving.

Though you inflate to stay on the surface and deflate to descend below it,
the rules for a BCD switch once you are underwater. Because a BCD is meant
to _compensate_ for changes in buoyancy, you deflate _as_ you go up and
inflate _as_ you go down. This is the opposite of what many expect until
they remember that buoyancy changes have a synergistic effect. As we rise,
we are under less pressure. This expands the air in our exposure suits and BCDs
which makes us positively buoyant and causes us to rise even faster. To 
avoid a runaway ascent, we should let out small bursts of air from our BCD, not
_to_ rise, but _because_ we are rising. Likewise, we avoid emergency descents
by inflating our BCD, which has begun to crush under higher pressure.

It's worth repeating that a BCD (and drysuit) should be adjusted in _small
increments_. If we add big bursts, we're likely to overshoot our goal and
it will be even harder to find the right level of inflation.

## 2. Use your breath

If your BCD isn't our buoyancy controller, what is? Our lungs. Lungs are
great because we're so used to using them. We'll never forget which way to
inflate or deflate our lungs like many new or rusty divers forget on their
BCD's inflator hose. If you want to go deeper, just breathe out more than a
normal breath and slowly "sip" the fresh air back in. If you want to go
shallower, breath in more than a normal breath and slowly exhale. You can even
use this trick to help find the right depth for your BCD rather than adjusting
your BCD for your depth. If your BCD makes you _slightly_ positively buoyant,
exhale deeply to decrease your buoyancy. If you decrease it enough to sink, the
increased water pressure will compress your BCD and make you neutrally buoyant
when you resume normal breathing.

Two rules worth repeating:

- _Never hold your breath while scuba diving_. Holding a full breath during
ascents can lead to lung overexpansion, which can be fatal.
- _Avoid shallow breathing_. Only the air that reaches our lungs (or
more accurately, the avioli) replenishes our blood with oxygen. The throat and
broncial cavity are "dead airspace." If we don't breath more volume than the
dead airspace, we're literally wasting our breath. If you find you're getting
headaches after diving (and trust the air quality of your dive shop), you may
be breathing too shallowly and suffering from carbon dioxide buildup.

## 3. Try to be stationary without kicking
I've seen divers with 2-3x my experience make this basic mistake. It's easier
to stay streamlined and feel neutrally buoyant while you're moving because
you're actually steering vertically. When you're stationary however, you
might find yourself oriented vertically and _kicking_ to avoid sinking.
This exertion wastes a lot of air; fix it by inflating your BCD until you
no longer need to kick. When properly buoyant, you can choose to stay
horizontally oriented and still. Save your kicks for moving or fighting a
current.

## 4. Find the correct amount of weight
Dive weights are a rich topic that merit a [separate post](weights). For
the purposes of this post, just remember that you'll need to overinflate
your BCD if you're overweighted. The more air you have in your BCD, the
more your volume will change as you change depth. This means your buoyancy
changes more rapidly and buoyancy control is less forgiving.

Still, it's better to be overweighted than underweighted. Throughout a
dive, you will lose mass due to the loss of air in your tank. This can
be a few pounds/kilos and will make you more positively buoyant. Carry
enough weight to avoid swimming downards towards the end of the dive.

## 5. Keep practicing
Use downtime to improve your buoyancy skills. Your
local dive shop may let you use the pool where they teach classes as
long as you're not away. You can use this time to practice fin
pivots and hovering. Since you should always practice using new gear in
confined water before you dive, these make especially good practices
when you buy a new BCD, wetsuit, or drysuit, as they affect your buoyancy
the most.

You can also practice buoyancy during safety stops. You may notice that
the most experienced divers can hover during their safety stops without
holding a rope. If you want to practice this skill, I recommend staying
close enough to the rope to grab it during an uncontrolled ascent or
descent. Hover with your arms outstreatched so you can continuously watch
your SPG or dive computer. Pros can sense small changes in their depth
through inner ear pressure; as a beginner you won't have this sixth sense yet.

## 6. Forgive yourself for struggling
Shallower water changes proportional density faster. A shift from 16ft (5m)
to 33ft (10m) is a change from 1.5atm to 2atm of pressure–a 33% increase.
Meanwhile, a shift from 66ft (20m) to 82ft (25m) is a change from 3atm to
3.5atm–a 16% increase. That's half the proportional density change with
the same change in depth!

As a new diver, you're more likely to dive in shallower depths. This means
you're learning an overwhelming skill in less forgiving waters. Remember there
is a big difference between "I'm struggling" and "I'm never going to get it."
Forgive yourself and give yourself time to hone your skills.
