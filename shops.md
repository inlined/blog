# Recommended dive shops

Dive shops vary significantly in quality of instruction. Some places are "under
the table" and let you dive without formal training (this seems quite common in
Cazumel, Mexico). Diving is a wonderful sport, but has the potential to be very
dangerous without proper training. I personally recommend getting trained in
your home town _before_ going on your dream dive vacation. This will let you
avoid spending vacation time on e-learning and let you spend more time in the
water since training dives tend to be shorter than recreational dives.

## Bay Area, California

My home shop is [Harbor Dive](1). Their classes can be
marginally more expensive than competitors, but I don't have dangerous horror
stories about their conduct unlike other shops. Harbor Dive's instructors are
fun and efficient. They pay meticulous attention to detail and really drill in
the important lessons in practical application. I've especially appreciated
times when the class was paused, the tone got serious, and they reminded or
quizzed me on important safety precautions.

For example, how do cold water and unfamiliar environments affect you when
diving? Both can increase the rate at which you breath, so you should add
10 feet or 3 meters for each to get a new theoretical dive depth. This is
especially important when diving with enriched air to avoid oxygen toxicity.

## Pheonix, Arizona

My "away" shop while visiting family in AZ is
[No Limits Scuba](2). Their staff is very competant,
their shop is well stocked, and they even give equipment discounts to students!
I especially enjoyed my [Rescue Diver](3) course, which was combined with
Emergency First Responder training and the [Emergency O2 Provider](4) specialty
course for a comprehensive training in the subject.

Be sure to check their board for their weekly "sale of the day" to get the best
rate on various supplies.
